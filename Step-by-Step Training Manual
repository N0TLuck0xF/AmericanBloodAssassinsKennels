Step-by-Step Training Manual
1. Basic Obedience (50 words)
Goal: Teach foundational commands for control and safety.

Method:

Sit: Hold a treat above your dog’s nose and move it backward. As their head follows the treat, their bottom will naturally lower. Say "Sit" and reward when they sit.

Stay: Ask your dog to sit, then hold your palm out and say "Stay." Take a step back. If they stay, reward them. Gradually increase distance and duration.

Come: Call your dog’s name followed by "Come." When they approach, reward them. Use a leash if needed.

Leave it: Place a treat in your hand and close your fist. Say "Leave it." When your dog stops trying to get it, reward them with a different treat.

Drop it: Offer a toy, then say "Drop it" and show a treat. When they release the toy, reward them.

Tips:

Practice in a distraction-free environment initially.

Use high-value treats for motivation.

Repeat each command 5-10 times per session.

2. Security/Protection Commands (50 words)
Goal: Teach commands for protection, guarding, and threat response.

Method:

Guard: Place your dog near an object or area and say "Guard." Reward them for staying alert and focused on the area.

Bite: Use a bite sleeve or tug toy. Encourage your dog to bite it, then say "Bite" and reward them.

Release: While your dog is biting, say "Release" and offer a treat. Reward them when they let go.

Attack: Work with a professional trainer for this command. Use a decoy and reward your dog for targeting on command.

Alert: Teach your dog to bark on command by saying "Alert" and rewarding them when they bark.

Tips:

Security training should be done under the guidance of a professional trainer.

Always prioritize safety and control.

Use clear, firm commands for protection work.

3. Sniffing/Tracking Commands (50 words)
Goal: Teach your dog to use their nose to find objects, people, or scents.

Method:

Find: Hide a treat or toy and say "Find." Encourage your dog to search for it. Reward them when they succeed.

Track: Use a scent trail (e.g., a treat or scent pad). Say "Track" and guide your dog along the trail. Reward them for following it.

Mark: When your dog finds the target, say "Mark" and reward them. This teaches them to indicate the find.

Search: Scatter treats or toys in an area and say "Search." Reward your dog for finding them.

Tips:

Start with easy searches and gradually increase difficulty.

Use high-value rewards for scent work.

Practice in different environments to generalize the skill.

4. Family/Socialization Commands (50 words)
Goal: Teach your dog to behave well around family and in social settings.

Method:

Gentle: Offer a treat and say "Gentle." If your dog takes it softly, reward them. If they snap, pull the treat away and try again.

Play: Use a toy and say "Play." Engage in a game of fetch or tug, rewarding them for participating.

Bed: Lead your dog to their bed and say "Bed." Reward them for staying there.

Crate: Toss a treat into the crate and say "Crate." Reward them for entering.

Tips:

Socialize your dog early with people, children, and other animals.

Use positive reinforcement to encourage calm, friendly behavior.

Practice commands in different locations to generalize the behavior.

5. Advanced Commands (50 words)

Weave: Set up poles or cones and guide your dog through them, saying "Weave." Reward them for completing the pattern.

Carry: Offer an object and say "Carry." Reward your dog for holding it in their mouth.

Open: Attach a rope to a door or drawer. Say "Open" and guide your dog to pull the rope. Reward them for success.

Push: Place a ball or toy in front of your dog and say "Push." Reward them for moving it with their nose or paw.
